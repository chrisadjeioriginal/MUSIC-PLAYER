What are you crying for?

You’re just the type of girl
...that I’ve been dying for 

Even if they’re hating
..you have my applause

Looking like you do,
girl you should count
...your stars ouuuu

You would’ve already 
...dried up your eyes 
If you could see you

(If you could see you)

Like I see you 
You would’ve already
eased up your mind

If you’d only see you
..how I see you
I see you 

You would’ve already
...dried up your eyes 
If you could see you 
(If you could see you)

Like I see you 
You would’ve already
eased up your mind

If you’d only see you
...how I see you
I see you 

What are you hiding for?

You’re in the happy ending
...I’ve been striving for

Girl, you’ve got a face
...that I would stand up for  
Girl, I saw your face and
...I swear I saw God

I was floored

With lips like yours 
With eyes like yours
With hips like yours

(Why would you cry ?)

With your sweet voice
Majestic poise 
With skin like soy

(Why would you cry?)

You would’ve already
...dried up your eyes 
If you could see you

(If you could see you)

Like I see you 
You would’ve already
...eased up your mind

If you’d only see you
...how I see you
I see you 

You would’ve already
...dried up your eyes 
If you could see you

(If you could see you)

Like I see you 
You would’ve already
...eased up your mind

If you’d only see you
...how I see you
I see you
